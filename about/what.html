            GNS for the majority of the time develops computer programs for physical systems.
            Once the development of the system is complete GNS then decides if it is viable to build the system in real life.
            How we decide this is a simple three point process. If the project passes all three points it then gets built.

        <ol>
            <li> Is it economical, i.e can we afford it. </li>
            <li> Is it realistic, i.e could we aquire the resources to build it</li>
            <li> Is it legal, i.e would be in violation of any laws by building it</li>

        This three point process allows us to maintain not only our time by not trying to build infeasible projects and failing but also saves us from having to worry about the gards busting out doors in
