        <p>
            GNS for the majority of the time develops computer programs for physical systems.
            Once the development of the system is complete GNS then decides if it is viable to build the system in real life.
            How we decide this is a simple three point process. If the project passes all three points it then gets built.
        </p>

    <div class="list">
        <ol>
            <li> Is it economical, i.e can we afford it. </li>
            <li> Is it realistic, i.e could we aquire the resources to build it</li>
            <li> Is it legal, i.e would be in violation of any laws by building it</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="whatpara2">
        <p>This three point process allows us to maintain not only our time by not trying to build infeasible projects and failing but also saves us from having to worry about the gards busting our doors in</p>

        <p> GNS stands for Generically Systems, the name is based off of what 
            I call my projects on my computer. I began to use this name in 2020 playing a game called besiege, it went on from there and I soon began using the name GNS on all of my projects
        </p>
        <p>The first thing I made and called GNS was a design for an AP shell in a physics sandbox game known as besiege</p>
