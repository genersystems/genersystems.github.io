    <p>The main plan for this is to use a Stewart Platform stacked ontop of another Stewart Platform,</p>
    <p> these two platforms together should provide not only the degrees of motion required but also the range of motion required.</p>
    <p> The software for this project is almost in a production state</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>The three checks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> We already are in possession of most of the motors required to create this so cost passes </li>
        <li> As we are in possession of most of the materials required it is very much possibile to make </li>
        <li> As far as we are aware there are no laws against small robotic arms so it passes</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p> As it has passed all the tests, once the software is production ready the robot can be built</p>
